‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
Free Tier Constraints
Backend Cold Start:
Render's free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. First request may take 30-60 seconds. Mitigated with UptimeRobot monitoring.
Stock Data:
Yahoo Finance API rate-limits cloud server requests. When this occurs, the app falls back to realistic simulated data. The infrastructure for real-time data is fully functional‚Äîit's a free-tier API limitation, not a code issue.
NewsAPI Rate Limits:
Free tier allows 100 requests/day. Smart caching (10-minute intervals) keeps usage well within limits for typical portfolio traffic.
Browser Compatibility
Tested and working on:

‚úÖ Chrome 90+
‚úÖ Firefox 88+
‚úÖ Safari 14+
‚úÖ Edge 90+
